- We seek papers to be presented (as posters) at AKBC 2022 in London, Nov 3-5th! AKBC will be an exciting conference with an amazing lineup of invited speakers, and itâ€™ll be a great opportunity to publicize your work! For this, we seek papers that **are already accepted** at other venues (but not currently under submission). If your paper is currently under submission at another conference, you cannot submit to this option. The decision will be based on the quality of the publication, topical fit and the capacity of the AKBC venue.
- We have two deadlines for the call for poster participation. The first deadline is set for people to arrange travel earlier, and the second deadline is for people who would like to present their recently accepted paper (for example, after the EMNLP notification on October 6th!).
  - Deadline: August 30th, Decision: September 5th \
    Submission site: [https://openreview.net/group?id=AKBC.ws/2022/Abstracts/August](https://openreview.net/group?id=AKBC.ws/2022/Abstracts/August).
  - Deadline: October 10th, Decision: October 15th \
    Submission site: TBD
