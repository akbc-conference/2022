<h2>Submission</h2>
Applicants for the Volunteer/scholarship Program should fill in this [form](https://forms.office.com/r/1etDQmftUx)
* **Application deadline:** September 30, 2022
* **Notification of acceptance:**  October 4, 2022

<h2>Volunteer Program</h2>
We seek a limited number of volunteers for the 4th Conference on Automated Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC), which will be held in London, UK from November 3 to 5, 2022. In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, volunteers receive free registration to the main conference, (including workshops and tutorials). The work will be divided, probably into two half-day shifts, and the shifts will be scheduled to maximize volunteer access to the conference events.

As AKBC 2022 will be hybrid, we are seeking volunteers to help us for both in-person and virtual tasks.

In-person tasks will include assisting at the registration desk, stuffing delegate packs, and providing assistance for conference events including tutorials, the main conference, and workshops. Virtual tasks will include organizing video presentations, acting as technical host for live video Q&A sessions, and providing assistance for conference events including tutorials, the main conference, and workshops.

Volunteer Award applicants should wait for a decision regarding the application to be communicated by the notification date. If an award is made, the awardee should register for the conference and use a code that will be provided to have registration fees waived.

<h2>Scholarship Program (D&I and Walker Fund Awards)</h2>
Through the Scholarship Program, we will offer a limited number of grants to assist participants from student backgrounds and non-profit affiliations with travel to London for AKBC 2022, as well as with conference expenses (such as housing, local transportation to/from airport, conference registration, etc.).

Successful applicants for the Scholarship Program must also participate in the Volunteer Program, and will receive free registration to the main conference in addition to their scholarships. Please note that these scholarships are to subsidize student participation in AKBC 2022, under-represented groups, and participants from non-profit institutions. These are not intended to cover all travel and conference expenses. The final amount of the scholarship will vary depending on the cost of the travel, quantity of money available, and the number and type of applicants.

Awardees should make travel arrangements and accommodation independent of the results of their application. Awardees will be reimbursed after the conference and upon providing scanned travel and accommodation receipts and an accounting of the requested funding. Further details are to be announced later. 

<h2>Selection Criteria</h2>

If you have any questions, please get in touch with our [workshop chairs]({{ site.baseurl }}/organization/).

Applicants for both the Volunteer Program and the Scholarship Program will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages (see below for the submission requirements). Preference will be given to students who are presenting a paper in the main conference or any of the associated workshops and do not have other means of travel support.
