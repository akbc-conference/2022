**The call for workshops is now closed**

We are soliciting proposals for half-day workshops at the fourth annual international conference on Automated Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC) to be held as a physical/online-hybrid conference in London. The conference dates are 3rd-5th November 2022.

Knowledge gathering, representation, and reasoning are among the fundamental challenges of artificial intelligence. Large-scale repositories of knowledge about entities, relations, and their abstractions are known as “knowledge bases”. Most major technology companies now have substantial efforts in knowledge base construction, and related scholarly work spans many research areas, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, information integration, databases, search, data mining, knowledge representation, human computation, human-computer interfaces, and fairness. The AKBC conference serves as a research forum for all these areas, in both academia and industry.

In addition to the conference, AKBC 2022 will include workshops dedicated to vibrant sub-areas of knowledge base construction with tighter focus (e.g., scientific literature), or the intersection between knowledge base construction and other areas (e.g., trust, benchmarking, security).



In the past, we have had workshops on topics such as multimodality, structured and unstructured KBs, scientific texts, biases in KB. Full list of workshops from previous AKBC conferences can be found here: [2021 Workshops](https://www.akbc.ws/2021/workshops/), [2020 workshops](https://www.akbc.ws/2020/workshops/), [2019 workshops](https://www.akbc.ws/2019/workshops/). Many workshops were very successful, with 100+ audiences, a great line-up of invited speakers, and engaging discussions. The organizers of the accepted workshop proposals will have the freedom to organize, run, and publicize their workshop as they wish, including reviewing submissions, planning the workshop schedule, inviting speakers and planning panel discussions.

There are also vibrant areas that involve either specialized knowledge base construction (e.g., scientific literature), or the intersection between knowledge base construction and other areas (e.g., trust, benchmarking, security). We are soliciting proposals for half-day workshops at AKBC 2022 that connect Automated Knowledge Base Construction with these and other areas of computer science.

Proposals for Workshops should be submitted using the [submission link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNNadbnaAMBPPm3_L1bGKoQWhZnJkN6JxD207DHXr2vnkHnw/viewform?usp=send_form), providing a one-pager document that specifies:

 * The title of the workshop.
 * A short description of the workshop goals, themes, topics, and open questions.
 * The format of the workshop (virtual / physical / hybrid) as well as anticipated proportion of keynote talks, invited papers, papers or abstracts from an open call, panels, etc.
 * A list of likely attendees of the workshop, including keynote speakers and their perspectives, panel participants, paper submitters, etc. and whether these are confirmed
 * Link to previous editions of the workshop, if any
 * Anticipated program committee members

We provide a tentative timeline for the workshops below, to help with planning.
